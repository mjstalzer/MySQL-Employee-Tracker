  ### Description: This CLI allows a user to control a MySQL database of company employees. From the command line they can select the function they need and follow a series of inquirer prompts to complete a task. This app allows them to view all employees, view roles, and view departments. In addition, they can add however many employees, roles, and departments they would like. If they wish to view the changes they made, they will display in the view all categories.
